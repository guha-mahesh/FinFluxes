Welcome to Policy Playground by Pushin Policy! Our app is designed to empower individuals working with economic public policy by providing data-driven insights to support the legislative process.

Through interactive fiscal and monetary tools, users can explore and predict key economic indicators such as the S&P 500 and GDP. Policy Playground also offers access to historical policy data, politicians’ records, and their associated economic impacts—helping economists, lobbyists, and policymakers make informed decisions with confidence.
