# Policy Playground

Welcome to Policy Playground by Pushin' Policy! Our app is designed to empower individuals working with economic public policy by providing data-driven insights to support the legislative process.

Through interactive fiscal and monetary tools, users can explore and predict key economic indicators such as the S&P 500 and GDP. Policy Playground also offers access to historical policy data, politicians’ records, and their associated economic impacts—helping economists, lobbyists, and policymakers make informed decisions with confidence.


Our tools include:
- AI Models to predict Currency Exchange Rates, Market Indicators such as the SPY or the FTSE, and the GDP/Capita of a country based off of fiscal and monetary policy.
- Note taking features for Lobbyists to keep track of their conversations with politicians and view the politicians proposed policies and their implications
